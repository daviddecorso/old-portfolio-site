Personal website with links to my resume, email, linkedin, and github.


Todo:
* Add a more detailed about me section below initial page
  (same page, but hidden behind accessible mouseclick, probably an arrow below the links section that scrolls down)
  - talk about skills, link to projects, etc.
  
 * Change picture
   - change picture to a professional-looking headshot
